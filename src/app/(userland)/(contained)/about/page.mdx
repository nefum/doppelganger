Hey everyone, my name is Parker. I'm the CEO and founder of Nefum LLC and the lead software engineer for Doppelganger.

I have been writing software since I was 14, and I started by writing proxies to circumvent web filters in my school.

I struggled to find a productive use of my full-stack skills (Next.js, Android, Docker, web-based remote access) until I was waiting to board a later-canceled flight at EWR and figured out that no app existed for people who wanted general-purpose virtual phones in the cloud.

Over the summer of 2024, I began building Doppelganger from scratch. A month and 140 hours of dev time later, the first versions of Doppelganger could spin up devices and connect to them. Soon, it became a fully featured platform for remote access to virtual devices.

Doppelganger is not just a software product; it's my first startup. I'm thrilled to see where this journey takes us, and I'm even more excited to have you join me on the ride.
