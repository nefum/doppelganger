Doppelganger supports a wide range of device types, each with its own unique features and capabilities.

New device types are added regularly, so check back often to see what's new. If you would like a specific device type added, [please let us know](/contact).

Here are the currently available device types. Premium-only device types are marked with a crown icon.

Some device types may rotate in and out based on availability and demand. Device created with a device type that is no longer available will remain accessible, unless the device type had to be removed due to a security or compatibility issue.
