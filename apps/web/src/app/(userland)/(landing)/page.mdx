Instead of sharing multiple unrestricted logins to various social media accounts, share a Doppelganger account and log in to your accounts once. Because Doppelganger is accessible through any web browser, your team can maintain their current workflow without having access to your valuable social media logins. Doppelganger provides a secure solution, giving you peace of mind and protecting your brand's identity.",
