Introducing our killer feature.

## What is Multiview?

Multiview is a feature that allows you to use multiple virtual android devices simultaneously. No matter if you are a mobile gamer needing multiple accounts, a productivity power user, or an app reviewer who needs to test an app on different screen sizes simultaneously, Multiview can get the job done.

Are you ready to crush your favorite games with multiple accounts, or ace your school projects with side-by-side research? Multiview is your secret weapon!

Multiview requires the Doppelganger Pro subscription. You can try the single-device experience with the free version of Doppelganger.
